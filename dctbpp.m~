% each sub-image occupies an N by N square in Yr therefore the number of
% subimages is (no. pixels in Yr) / N^2 
% dimensions of Yr are assumed to be multiples of N for our purposes

% do they really want us to calculate the total number of bits or the bits
% per pixel?

% bpp(Yr) gives 1.6728
% dctbpp(Yr) ives 1.1989 i.e. lower entropy calculated when we evaluate
% each sub-image individually - this means that pixels within a sub-image
% are more closely correlated than pixels in different sub-images, as
% expected - therefore by evaluating each sub-image indivually there is
% more predictability in the pixel values - in this way DCT allows image
% compression
